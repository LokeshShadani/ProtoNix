# PROTONIX

## Training an AI Model from First Principles

## Overview

**PROTONIX** is an experimental artificial intelligence system built entirely from scratch using Python.  
The project focuses on understanding how intelligence can emerge from simple mathematical and logical foundations—without relying on pre-trained models, cloud APIs, or black-box frameworks.

PROTONIX starts at zero and learns through structured training cycles.

---

## Objectives

- Design a learning system from first principles
- Implement model architecture manually
- Build the full training loop
- Understand loss, optimization, and improvement
- Maintain full transparency over how learning occurs

---

## What Makes PROTONIX Different

- No pre-trained weights
- No external AI APIs
- No shortcuts or abstractions
- Every learning step is explicit and controlled

This project prioritizes **understanding over performance**.

---

## Core Concepts Covered

- Data representation
- Forward computation
- Loss calculation
- Parameter updates
- Training iterations (epochs)
- Evaluation and refinement

---

## Planned Model Scope

The initial versions of PROTONIX will focus on:
- Simple models with explainable behavior
- Gradual increase in complexity
- Clear learning progression

Advanced architectures will only be introduced after fundamentals are solid.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `json` / `csv`

Heavy ML frameworks are intentionally avoided early.
