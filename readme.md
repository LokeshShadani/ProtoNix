## ⚛️ What is PROTONIX?

**PROTONIX** is an experimental AI system built **entirely from scratch** using Python.

No pre-trained models.  
No cloud APIs.  
No black boxes.

The project explores how **intelligence can emerge from simple mathematical foundations**, starting from a zero-knowledge state and improving through structured training cycles.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a learning system from first principles
- Implement model logic manually
- Understand training, loss, and optimization deeply
- Maintain full transparency of how learning happens
- Learn by building — not by abstracting

---

## 🚫 What PROTONIX Is Not

- ❌ Not an API wrapper (OpenAI / Gemini / HF)
- ❌ Not a pre-trained demo
- ❌ Not production-focused
- ❌ Not framework-heavy

This is a **fundamental learning project**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Data representation & preprocessing
- Forward computation
- Loss functions
- Parameter updates
- Training loops (epochs)
- Evaluation & improvement

Each component is written to be **readable, traceable, and explainable**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy` – numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` – learning visualization
  - `csv` / `json` – data handling

> Heavy ML frameworks are intentionally avoided in early stages.
